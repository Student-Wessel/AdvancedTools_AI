First i ran the same config 3 times to check how much randomness there was while using the same config. 
You can see these runs as starting_config_moveJump_v1_run_1..3

When looking at the data, you can see that there is a lot of variance in the 3 runs. Looking at run 2, you can see fairly early on that it found a method of getting to the goal. Looking at run 1 it seems to also starting to find something but is not as good as run 2. Looking at run 3 is kinda suprising because after 2 million steps, it did not found a good method of getting towards the goal.
